# PY-101 Programming Foundations with Python: Basics

This section of the textbook covers the most baseline fundamentals of Python coding — it’s literally in the title of the section. It covers variables, data types, functions, conditional loops, collections, code conventions, and gimmicky Python behaviors. This repository serves as a master directory that stores all projects and assignments done within PY-101.

> [!NOTE]
>
> All the projects have been pushed to GitHub as independent projects before due to my misunderstanding of how the projects should be pushed. Those repositories are not deleted so the change history can be tracked. In this repository, all the .git files are removed, meaning there are no nested git repositories.
