# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple rock paper scissors program that implements the Spock and Lizard rule. The program asks for a user input, for one of the moves. 

### Program Process

The user can type their decision out or type the abbreviated versions: `r` for rock, `p` for paper, `sc` for scissors, `sp` for Spock, `l` for Lizard. 

It prints the result along with the scoreboard. The game repeats until either the player or the computer gets three points (best of five).
