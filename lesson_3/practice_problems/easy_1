# Practice Problems: Easy 1

### Question 1

Will the code below raise an error?

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers[6] = 5
```

The code will raise an `IndexError` because `numbers` only has an index value of 2. The error will be caught when trying to access an non-existent out of bounds element.
