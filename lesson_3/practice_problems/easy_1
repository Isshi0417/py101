# Practice Problems: Easy 1

### Question 1

Will the code below raise an error?

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
numbers[6] = 5
```

The code will raise an `IndexError` because `numbers` only has an index value of 2. The error will be caught when trying to access an non-existent out of bounds element.

### Question 2

How can you determine whether a given string ends with an exclamation mark(!)? Write some code that prints `True` or `False` depending on whether the string ends with an exclamation mark.

```python
str1 = "Come over here!"
str2 = "What's up, Doc?"

# endswith() can be used to determine the last character
print(str1.endswith("!"))	# True
print(str2.endswith("!"))	# False
```
