# Lesson 2

Lesson 2 focuses on making small programs as a small practice for getting used to programming in Python and using GitHub.

## Projects

### Calculator

A simple program that performs an arithmetic operation of choice on two numbers. The core concept of this program is `while` loops. The loops are used to determine whether user inputs are valid and in appropriate format.

### Mortgage / Car Loan Calculator

A simple program that calculates monthly loan payments based on the information given by the user. The core concept of this program is similar to the `Calculator` program. `while` loops are used to validate user inputs.

### Rock Paper Scissors

A simple program that plays Rock Paper Scissors against a computer. Additional rules are added to bring more complexity to the game: Spock and Lizard. The core concept of this program is `if` statements. Many conditional statements and conditions are used to determine the winner of each round.
